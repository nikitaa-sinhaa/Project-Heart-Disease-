## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various medical attributes. The process includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 14 attributes and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

## Model
The notebook explores several machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Neural Networks

## Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook provides detailed visualizations and comparisons of the models' performance.
